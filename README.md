**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The To-Do List web application is a straightforward yet powerful tool designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The project serves as an example of how fundamental web development technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—can be combined to create a practical, user-friendly application.

**Key Features**
Task Management: Users can add new tasks to their list, view all tasks, and remove them once completed.
Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, ensuring that the list persists even when the page is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened.
Responsive Design: The application is styled using CSS to ensure that it is visually appealing and works well across different screen sizes.

**Technical Details**
HTML: Provides the basic structure of the application, including input fields for task entry and an area to display the list of tasks.
CSS: Offers styling for the layout, ensuring a modern and clean user interface. It also includes responsive design techniques to adapt the display for various devices.
JavaScript: Powers the application’s interactivity, allowing tasks to be added, marked as complete, and removed. JavaScript also handles the saving and retrieval of tasks from local storage, maintaining the state of the task list.

**Purpose and Application**
The project demonstrates how essential web development skills can be applied to build a functional application that solves a common problem—task management. It is a great example of how to effectively use front-end technologies to create an interactive and persistent user experience.
