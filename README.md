**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Project Objective**
The goal of this project is to create a dynamic Weather Forecasting Site that allows users to get weather updates for over 200,000 cities worldwide. The website is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean interface that displays essential weather information such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: The structure of the webpage is built using HTML, providing a clean and semantic layout.
CSS: The site uses an external stylesheet (style.css) for styling. Bootstrap is also integrated to enhance the design with pre-built classes and responsive utilities.
JavaScript: A script.js file is included to handle dynamic content such as fetching weather data from an API, processing user input, and updating the UI.
Bootstrap: Version 5.0.0-beta1 of Bootstrap is used to style the input forms, buttons, and layout.

**Key Components**
Header Section: The header of the site includes the title "Weather Forecasting Site" and a brief description emphasizing the global coverage of the forecast data.
City Input Form: A floating input form allows users to enter the name of the city for which they want the weather forecast. The form is styled using Bootstrap's form-control class, ensuring responsiveness and ease of use.
Weather Information Card: The core feature of the site is the weather information card, which dynamically displays the weather data for the city entered by the user. This includes:
City name
Current date
Temperature (current, minimum, and maximum)
Atmospheric pressure
Humidity level
Wind speed
Visibility
Cloud coverage
Weather description

**User Interaction**
Users can enter a city name into the input field and click the "Enter" button to submit. Once submitted, the site retrieves the weather data from an external API (presumably through the script.js file) and displays the relevant information in the weather information card.
